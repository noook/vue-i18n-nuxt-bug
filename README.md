# Workflow Summary App

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure you have the correct version of node. You can easily check, and automatically install the right version by running

```bash
nvm install
```


To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
make install
```

It will automatically pick the right version.

## Development server

You can run the development server by running

```bash
make start
```

This will run the development server in debug mode with the `9244` inspection port.

You can also run the server through the VSCode workflows tab. Two options are available:

- **Attach workflow-summary-app** will attach to the node process you previously launched
- **Run workflow-summary-app in Debug mode** will run and auto attach to the process.
